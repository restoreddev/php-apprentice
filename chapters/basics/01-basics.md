If you want to follow along by writing code, start by downloading a code editor. I recommend
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/).
Next, create a new file in your editor called `basics.php` and save it anywhere on your computer, like a folder
in your documents called `phpapprentice`. Now, we can write some PHP.

All PHP files must start with a `<?php` tag unless it is for a html template.
(We will learn about html templates later.)
```php
<?php

echo "Hello World!\n";
```

There is a lot going on in the above code so let's work through it.

First, the echo keyword tells PHP to output some text.
```php
echo "I am some text\n";
```

Second, PHP stores text in strings. To write a string, you surround letters with single or double quotes.
Double quoted strings can hold special characters like `\n` which tells PHP to start a new line.
```php
echo "I am a string on a new line\n";
```

Third, all lines of code in PHP must end in a semi-colon.
```php
echo "No semi-colon is a no-no\n";
```

Using semi-colons means we can write multiple statements on one line.
```php
echo "PHP"; echo " Apprentice\n";
```

To execute the code you have written, make sure you have [PHP installed](/installing-php.html).
Then, open a terminal app, either Terminal on MacOS or Powershell on Windows. In the terminal,
open the folder where you created the `basics.php` file using `cd`. For example, on Windows run `cd C:\%userprofile%\Documents\phpapprentice` and on Mac run `cd ~/Documents/phpapprentice`. Finally, you can execute the file by running `php basics.php`.

In your terminal, you should see:
```bash
Hello World!
I am some text
I am a string on a new line.
No semi-colon is a no-no
PHP Apprentice
```

With any code in future chapters, I recommend writing a PHP file for it.
It is a great way to get some practice with the language.
